 * next block.

 * One major issue is how the "random" input is determined, since
 * all miners must agree on this result.  In this version, we use

 * There are two problems with our approach:
 * 1) If the chosen miner is not available, the protocol gets stuck.
 * 2) A clever miner could bias the block to their advantage.
