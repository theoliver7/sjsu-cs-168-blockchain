/**
 * Our PoW/PoS hybrid is very loosely patterned after PeerCoin.
 * Like them, we use the notion of coin age.
 *
 * In our implementation, whenever money is spent or a miner
 * finds a proof, the coin age is set to 0.  Otherwise, it
 * increases by the client's balance of coins each round.
 *
 * For example, let's say Alice has 50 coins, Bob has 20,
 * and Charlie has 10.  After 2 rounds, Alice's coin age
 * will increase by 100 points; Bob's will increase by 40;
 * and Charlie's will increase by 20.  If Alice then spends
 * some of her coins, her coin age would be set to 0. Then,
 * the following block everyone's coin age increases again,
 * giving Alice 50 coin age units and raising Bob & Charlie's
 * coin age units to 60 and 30 respectively.
 *
 * When searching for a proof for a block, the PoW target
 * is increased (making it easier to find) by one leading
 * zero for every 500 units of coin age the miner has available
